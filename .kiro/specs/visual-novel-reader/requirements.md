# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a visual novel reader application built with Vue 3 and TypeScript. The application allows users to read interactive visual novels with background images, character sprites, text dialogue, and navigation controls. The visual novel content is structured as scenes containing sequential steps that represent story progression points.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a reader, I want to view visual novel content with background and foreground images, so that I can experience an immersive visual storytelling experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a visual novel scene loads THEN the system SHALL display a background image that fills the viewport
2. WHEN a scene step contains character sprites THEN the system SHALL display foreground character images overlaid on the background
3. WHEN multiple characters are present THEN the system SHALL position them appropriately without overlap
4. IF no background image is specified THEN the system SHALL display a default background

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a reader, I want to read dialogue text in a dedicated text box, so that I can follow the story narrative clearly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a scene step contains text THEN the system SHALL display the text in a styled text box at the bottom of the screen
2. WHEN text is longer than the text box THEN the system SHALL handle text overflow appropriately
3. IF a step has no text THEN the system SHALL hide the text box
4. WHEN text changes THEN the system SHALL update the text box content smoothly

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a reader, I want to navigate through the visual novel using a next button, so that I can progress through the story at my own pace.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing a scene step THEN the system SHALL display a "Next" button
2. WHEN the next button is clicked THEN the system SHALL advance to the next step in the current scene
3. WHEN reaching the end of a scene THEN the system SHALL advance to the first step of the next scene
4. WHEN reaching the end of the story THEN the system SHALL disable the next button or show completion state
5. IF there are no more steps available THEN the system SHALL prevent further navigation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a well-defined TypeScript structure for visual novel data, so that I can easily create and maintain story content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining story structure THEN the system SHALL use TypeScript interfaces for type safety
2. WHEN creating story content THEN the system SHALL organize content into scenes and steps
3. WHEN a step is defined THEN the system SHALL support optional background image, character sprites, and text properties
4. WHEN scenes are defined THEN the system SHALL contain an ordered array of steps
5. WHEN the story is defined THEN the system SHALL contain an ordered array of scenes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want example story data that demonstrates the structure, so that I can understand how to create visual novel content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is built THEN the system SHALL include a sample story file at assets/story.ts
2. WHEN the sample story is loaded THEN the system SHALL demonstrate multiple scenes with different backgrounds
3. WHEN the sample story is loaded THEN the system SHALL demonstrate character sprite changes
4. WHEN the sample story is loaded THEN the system SHALL demonstrate text dialogue progression
5. WHEN the sample story is loaded THEN the system SHALL demonstrate scene transitions

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a reader, I want responsive visual components that adapt to different screen sizes, so that I can enjoy the visual novel on various devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads on different screen sizes THEN the system SHALL scale images appropriately
2. WHEN the viewport changes THEN the system SHALL maintain proper aspect ratios for images
3. WHEN on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL ensure text remains readable
4. WHEN on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL ensure the next button remains accessible
